    <H1>INTRODUCTION TO FAST FASHION</H1>
    <P>Fast fashion is an industry that produces trendy clothes at cheap prices .It describes about stylish , mass produced clothes that have a drastic impact on our
       environment . It is the business model of replicating recent catwalk trends and high-fashion designs, and bringing them to retail stores quickly while demand 
       is at its highest.</P>
    <P> Nowadays ,  people buy clothes just in order to keep themselves updated with trend going around them . Since, fashion keeps on changing with time the cloths 
        starts getting piled up .Fashion is not the same as we see it today. Fast fashion gets its name from its business design – where everything is done at rapid 
        fire speed.We have fashion for almost everything now .For knowing how and from where the term "Fast Fashion" emerged we have to go in the history of fashion . </P>
        
    <H1>HISTORY OF FAST FASHION</H1>
    <p> The history of Fast Fashion is quite a brief but an interesting one . The term , “Fast Fashion” was first used at the beginning of the 1990s , when Zara opened 
        in New York .The New York Times used the phrase , “Fast Fashion” to explain Zara’s goal to take a fashion piece from the stages of being designed to hanging on 
        a clothing store rack in a mere 15 days.</p>
    <p>  After knowing the history, about how and when was the term ,"Fast Fashion" coined I shall now proceed on to thevery next topic , that is , "HAZARDS OF FAST FASHION ON ENVIRONMENT" . 
         Now let's move to the our topic. </p>
         
    <H1>HAZARDS OF FAST FASHION ON ENVIRONMENT</H1>
    <p> Within this important part of our topic we are going to firstly discuss the ill effects of Fast fashion on our lives and on our environment.Before we start with it
        I must mention that fashion was not a destructive industry since the start .It started to harm when people began using poisonous substances.Lets now elaborate some
        important disadvantageous points of "Fast Fashion".</p>
    <p>1)The industry uses cheap , toxic textile dyes , a major textile waste , for mass production , making it a part of world's largest contaminators of water, as well as
       of agriculture .</p>
    <p>2)The workers are made to work in dangerous environment for low wages . This leads to the their exploitation . Even they dont get proper fundamental rights.They even
       face brutal practices which effects their physical and mental health . This major hazard or we may say a devastating plight was highlighted in the documentary , 
       "The True Cost".
    <p>3)The micro fibres and toxic textile wastes are released in water it effects the wildlife also . Animals drink water and consume these poisonous substances unknowingly 
         and face hazardous conditions of health . </p>
    <p>4)Thefaux fur which commonly passed down to the shoppers . The fur is raised under harsh conditions just to raise it at less cost and earn more profit .</p>
    <p>5)Fast fashion makes us believe we need to shop more and more to stay on top of trends, creating a constant sense of need and ultimate dissatisfaction.Fast 
         fashion can impact consumers themselves, encouraging a “throw-away” culture because of both the built-in obsolescence of the products and the speed at which 
         trends emerge.</p>
    <p>Here , I now switch to my next sub-topic , that is , "IS FAST FASHION GOING GREEN ? RETHINK ABOUT IT"So let's proceed to the next sub-topic.</p>
    
    <H1>IS FAST FASHION GOING GREEN ? RETHINK ABOUT IT.</H1>
    <p>As an increasing number of consumers call out the true cost of the fashion industry, and especially fast fashion, we’ve seen a growing number of retailers 
       introduce so-called sustainable and ethical fashion initiatives such as in-store recycling schemes.Now there must be a question arising that what are the in-store
       recycling schemes that are helping to reduce the environmental damage ? There are many ways undertaken for the recycling of clothes .One of such method is second hand
       marketing . In this very way we can sell our old cloths to small shops which sell second hand goods .If you are you are looking for other ways of reusing the old fashion
       goods then you can convert them into new items.For example , we have an old long jeans.We can use them to make handbags.This will not only help to reuse and recycle but
       will also help to reduce requirements for plastic bags.</p>
    <p>Let us explore other ways to go green with the fast fashion .Here we are going to elaborately explain about methods that are in action to reduce damages as well as 
       the other possible ways to do the same both in our country and abroad . So , let's begin .</p>
    <p>Firstly , we will discuss this with reference to our country . Our country has found many ways to reduce this type of waste .We will discuss seven of these ways.Our
       first way is exchange of old clothes with utensils.This way is quite common in the states of Jharkhand , West Bengal , Bihar and Chattisgarh . Here the utensil 
       sellers basically follow the barter system .They sell us the vessels travelling place to place in the city in exchange of cloths which they go and further sell to 
       some local factories and earn livelihood . Sometimes , they also keep some of the cloths for themselves and their families . Therefore this way has proved to be 
       quite a successful way for recycling old goods . Second way is the use of old things again and again in different ways. For example , usage of cloths as handbags and
       cloth for washing floors. Many of the families also use the cloths to block the water pipe leakages.This is the third way of using old items.The fourth way is by giving
       methodology of handling the goods is , like making handy helpfull tools from old fashion things like batteries for projects of schools, etc. Here in the fifth way ,
       we stich the cloths to use those old fashioned clothes to wear them in our houses . Next we in the sixth method we see that the old colors are used to decorate things like
       pottery.This art is commonly seen in South India . This also comes under the handicraft designing which quite famous in today's fashion world . Even the old broken items 
       have been used for arts like the famous "outsider art", which was used to make the famous " Rock Garden " in Chattisgarh . This was done at various places and hence can be termed
       as the seventh way of renovating the lands as well as reducing the ill effects of quickly changing fashions .</p>
    <p>Now we will talk about the ways taken up by some other contries to reduce this very problem .</p>
    <p>The first way is the local donation boxes available at local areas . In this a person can donate anything he or she wishes for the needy.Secondly ,in some nations
       there has been limitations on the production of the goods as per the needs imposed . This results in controlled management over the production and the pollution caused by these 
       textile industry wastes . The old fashioned materials to disposed have been classified . This helps in separate management of all sorts of textile wastes.
    <p>From our above discussion we can conclude that Fast Fashion thou not going completely green but is going green . Now , I would also like to add that it is our responsibility to
       control our sensation and feeling of being outdated. 
    
    <H1>CONCLUSION</H1>
    <P>We learnt about what is fast fashion . Then we learnt about the origin and the history of the term " FAST FASHION ". Further we discussed about the hazard of this very industry . 
       Afterwards , we ventured about the different ways in which the hazards are being controlled in India and in a few other nations.</p>
